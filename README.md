# MLFQ Design

1. Take number of queue **nq**, number of processes **np**,quantumn length **q**,boost time period **s** from the command line arguement
2. Create a linked list for the number of queues nq
3. Assign processes to q
4. Loop through the queues and execute processes for the defined quantumn length.
5. Show results when all processes are finished.
